To start the project, put the folder "crtav" into the "gap4r7" folder, start the system for computational discrete algebra GAP and enter the string

Read ( "/crtav/Main.g");

Also you can change the value of INPUT_MODE variable. The possible values is: "UpTo2", "UpTo3", "UpTo4", "UpTo5", "4", "5", "7", "Full".

Note: The performance of the program tested only in OS Vindovs 7 and GAP system version 4.7.9.
